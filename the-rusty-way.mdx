In this article we'll be implementing FizzBuzz in Rust `ðŸ¦€`  
We'll start with a naive implementation, and then we'll refactor it to make it more reusable. Along the way, we'll learn about Rust's `enum{:rust}`s and `trait{:rust}`s and play around with `match{:rust}` expressions, while using TypeScript for comparison.

I'm still learning Rust, so if you see any mistakes or have any suggestions, please let me know in the comments!

## Below is the rect component.

```jsx
function calculateFactorial(number) {
  if (number === 0 || number === 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return number * calculateFactorial(number - 1);
  }
}

const result = calculateFactorial(5); // Calculate factorial of 5
console.log(`Factorial of 5 is: ${result}`);
```

## Enums in Rust

One thing that stood out to me when learning Rust, was that unlike TypeScript enums, Rust enums are acutally useful.
If you're already familiar with Rust, you probably know Rust's `Result{:rust}` and `Option{:rust}` enums. If you're not, don't worry, we'll go over them right now.

The `Result{:rust}` enum is used to represent the result of a function that may fail. It has two variants: `Ok{:rust}` and `Err{:rust}`.

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
  Ok(T),
  Err(E),
}
```

When a function returns a `Result{:rust}`, whoever calls it knows they should handle both cases. This is a great way to ensure that errors are handled, and that the program doesn't just crash. In contrast, TypeScript doesn't have a way to enforce error handling, or even to represent the possibility of an error in the type system, so it all comes down to developer discipline and documentation.

One way to handle enums is to use a `match{:rust}` expression. This is similar to a `switch{:tsx}` statement in TypeScript, but it's more powerful. `match{:rust}` is exhaustive, which means that you have to handle every case, and the compiler will yell at you if you don't.

```rust showLineNumbers /i32/2 /()/1
//                    return type   error type
//                             \     /
fn may_fail(x: i32) -> Result<i32, ()> {
  if x !== 0 {
    Ok(x)
  } else {
    Err(())
  }
}

fn main() {
  match may_fail(42) {
    // If the function returns the Ok variant,
    // we unwrap the value inside and call it n.
    // This is similar to destructuring in TypeScript.
    Ok(n) => println!("Success: {}", n),
    // In our case, if the function returns the Err variant,
    // we don't need to bind it to a variable, so we use _
    Err(_) => println!("Failure"),
  }
}
```

The `Option{:rust}` enum is similar to `Result{:rust}`, but it's used to represent the possibility of a value. It has two variants: `Some{:rust}` and `None{:rust}`.

```rust
enum Option<T> {
  Some(T),
  None,
}
```

And we're done! We've implemented an extensible FizzBuzz function that can be modified to support any number of rules.
